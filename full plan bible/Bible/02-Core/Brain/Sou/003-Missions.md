## Purpose

Sou is the **sole creator of missions** in AIOS. No component outside the Brain can create missions (SOU-002). Sou defines what work needs to be done, frames success criteria, creates the mission, and delegates execution to Institutions (Organizations â†’ Workers).

Sou does not execute missions. It creates them, monitors progress, adjusts scope as needed, and learns from outcomes. Missions are the mechanism through which Sou's strategic intent becomes operational reality.

## Mission Lifecycle â€” Sou's Perspective

The canonical mission lifecycle (Physics/002-Missions.md, Physics/006-Lifecycles.md) has 10 states:

```
Created â†’ Planned â†’ Assigned â†’ Running â†’ Waiting â†’ Paused â†’ Blocked â†’ Review â†’ Completed â†’ Archived
```

Sou's involvement varies by state:

| State | Sou's Role | Sou Actions |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Created | Proposer | Sou creates the mission proposal (via Planner) and submits it to DGP |
| Planned | Approver of plan | Sou reviews and approves the detailed plan before assignment |
| Assigned | Observer | Sou monitors assignment to executing Organization |
| Running | Adjuster | Sou may propose adjustments based on evidence (via Reasoning â†’ new proposals) |
| Waiting | Observer | Sou monitors waiting state and may propose dependency resolution |
| Paused | Observer | Sou monitors pause reasons, may propose resume conditions |
| Blocked | Evaluator | Sou evaluates block reasons, may propose alternative approaches |
| Review | Evaluator | Sou participates in review â€” evaluates outcomes against goals |
| Completed | Learner | Sou ingests completion evidence for learning |
| Archived | Learner | Sou archives learnings to Knowledge store |

## Example â€” Mission Lifecycle from Sou's View

```
1. Created: Sou proposes "Resource Optimization Q3" mission (via Plannner â†’ DGP)
   â†’ DGP routes to Security Council â†’ Security Council approves
2. Planned: Organization develops detailed plan â†’ Sou approves plan
   â†’ Sou: "Plan approved. Conditions: weekly check-ins required."
3. Assigned: Organization assigns Workers â†’ Sou monitors assignment
   â†’ Sou: "All Workers assigned. Proceeding."
4. Running: Workers execute â†’ Sou monitors progress
   â†’ Monitor check: "Progress at 35%, on track."
5. Running â†’ Review: Check-in triggered (per condition)
   â†’ Sou evaluates: "37% done, resources used: 33%. Acceptable variance."
   â†’ Sou: "Approved to continue."
6. Completed: Mission finishes â†’ Sou evaluates outcome
   â†’ Sou: "Goal: optimize resources. Achievement: 92%. Lessons: phased rollout works."
7. Archived: Sou archives learnings â†’ Knowledge: "Q3 optimization lessons"
```

## Sou's Mission Operations

### proposeMission

```
Input:  goal, plan (from Planner), constitutional_check
Process: package as mission proposal â†’ submit to DGP
Output: MissionProposal { mission_id, proposal, evidence_chain }
Event: Sou.MissionProposed
```

### approveMissionPlan

```
Input:  mission_id, detailed_plan (from Organization)
Process: validate plan matches original proposal â†’ approve
Output: Approval { mission_id, approved_plan, conditions }
Event: Sou.MissionPlanApproved
```

### adjustMission

```
Input:  mission_id, adjustment_reason, proposed_changes
Process: reasoning on adjustment â†’ produce change proposal â†’ submit to DGP
Output: ChangeProposal { mission_id, changes, rationale }
Event: Sou.MissionAdjustmentProposed
```

### evaluateMissionOutcome

```
Input:  mission_id, completion_evidence
Process: compare outcome to goals â†’ assess success â†’ extract lessons
Output: OutcomeEvaluation { mission_id, goal_achievement, lessons }
Event: Sou.MissionOutcomeEvaluated
```

## Missions â€” Relationship to DTS

DTS provides confidence scoring for Sou's mission proposals:

| Sou Mission Action | DTS Input | DTS Output |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| proposeMission | Mission proposal + evidence | Confidence interval for mission success |
| adjustMission | Adjustment proposal + rationale | Confidence that adjustment improves outcome |
| evaluateMissionOutcome | Outcome evidence | Outcome validation (actual vs predicted) |
| monitorMission | Current mission state | Risk score (probability of mission failure) |

Sou uses DTS confidence to decide whether to proceed with a mission proposal or refine it.

## Mission Monitoring

Sou performs routine monitoring of active missions:

| Monitor Check | Frequency | Action on Deviation |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Progress vs milestones | Daily | If >20% deviation â†’ propose adjustment |
| Resource consumption vs plan | Weekly | If >30% deviation â†’ propose resource reallocation |
| Timeline adherence | Per milestone | If >2 days late â†’ assess impact |
| Risk indicators | Continuous | If risk materializes â†’ propose mitigation |
| Constitutional compliance | Continuous | If violation â†’ alert Security Council |

## Mission Adjustment Criteria

Sou may propose adjustments to missions when specific criteria are met:

| Criterion | Threshold | Adjustment Type |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Timeline deviation | >20% behind schedule | Extend timeline or reduce scope |
| Resource overconsumption | >30% over budget | Increase budget or reduce scope |
| Risk materialization | New risk probability >60% | Add mitigation milestone |
| Goal change | External change in priority | Re-scope mission objectives |
| Entity failure | Executing entity fails >3 times | Replace executing entity |
| Constitutional violation | Any violation detected | Pause mission, alert Security Council |

## Sou Evidence Consumption from Missions

Sou receives evidence from completed missions through the following flow:

```
Mission Execution â†’ Events â†’ Event Store â†’ ACF Stream â†’ Sou Learning
```

| Evidence Type | Produced By | Consumed By Sou |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Milestone completion | Organization / Workers | Planner (improve estimates), Learning (update models) |
| Resource consumption | ROS | Planner (refine resource estimation) |
| Errors and failures | Workers / Runtime | Learning (error pattern recognition) |
| Timing data | LMS | Planner (timeline realism updates) |
| Constitutional compliance | Security Council | Knowledge (constitutional precedent) |

## Events

| Event Type | Produced When | Fields |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `Sou.MissionProposed` | Sou creates a mission proposal | mission_id, goal, plan_id |
| `Sou.MissionPlanApproved` | Sou approves the detailed plan | mission_id, approved_by, conditions |
| `Sou.MissionAdjustmentProposed` | Sou proposes a mission change | mission_id, adjustment_type, rationale |
| `Sou.MissionOutcomeEvaluated` | Sou evaluates mission completion | mission_id, goal_achievement_score, lessons |
| `Sou.MissionMonitored` | Sou performs a routine monitor check | mission_id, state, health_score |
| `Sou.MissionInterventionRequested` | Sou requests governance intervention | mission_id, reason, severity |

## Edge Cases â€” Missions

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Mission proposal is rejected by DGP | Sou records rejection. Reasoning may adjust goal and re-propose. Rejection evidence is stored in Knowledge. |
| Mission enters Blocked state and cannot be resolved | Sou evaluates available options: adjust mission, replace executing entity, or abort. If abort â†’ propose new plan. |
| Mission completes but evidence is incomplete | Sou evaluates with available evidence. Gaps are noted in outcome evaluation. Confidence is reduced. |
| Sou proposes adjustment while mission is in Review | Adjustment is queued. Review must complete before adjustment is applied. |
| Mission's parent Organization is dissolved | Sou is notified. Sou proposes mission transfer to another Organization or mission termination. |
| Sou receives conflicting evidence from mission | Evidence from different sources is weighted by source trust. Higher-trust source takes precedence. |
| Mission exceeds its planned duration significantly | Sou evaluates cause. May propose scope reduction, resource increase, or mission termination. |

## Error Cases

| Condition | Error Code | Severity | Recovery |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| Mission proposal missing required evidence chain | SOU_MIS_001 | High | Block proposal; require evidence from Reasoning before submission |
| Mission goal does not derive from Human Intent (Law 1 violation) | SOU_MIS_002 | Critical | Reject proposal permanently; log constitutional violation for review |
| Cannot adjust mission in terminal state (Completed / Archived) | SOU_MIS_003 | Medium | Return error; propose new mission if adjustment is necessary |
| Mission outcome evaluation missing completion evidence | SOU_MIS_004 | High | Evaluate with available evidence; mark gaps and reduce confidence |
| Mission monitor detects unrecoverable state | SOU_MIS_005 | Critical | Escalate to Security Council; propose mission termination |

## Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Enforcement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| SOU-MIS-001 | Sou is the sole creator of missions in AIOS | Governance â€” no other component may create missions |
| SOU-MIS-002 | Sou never executes missions â€” only creates, monitors, and learns | Architectural â€” no execution path in Sou |
| SOU-MIS-003 | Every mission proposal traces to a Human Intent | Schema â€” Law 1 evidence chain required |
| SOU-MIS-004 | Mission adjustments are always proposed, never applied directly | API-level â€” adjustMission produces proposal, not mutation |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

Mission proposals are verified by DGP. Organizational approval is required before execution. All Sou mission operations produce Events for audit by the Security Council. (Physics/008-Security.md)

### Evidence

Every mission action produces Events. Sou consumes mission evidence for learning. Evidence chains from Law 1 (Origin) are preserved â€” every mission traces to Human Intent. (PHI-008, CPR-004)

### Lifecycle

Sou's mission oversight follows the canonical lifecycle (Physics/006-Lifecycles.md). Sou is involved at key transition points: Created (propose), Running (adjust), Completed/Archived (evaluate/learn). (PHI-006)

### Capability Bounds

Sou may propose, monitor, adjust, and evaluate missions. It may NOT approve mission execution, allocate resources to missions, or directly communicate with Workers executing missions. (Physics/007-Capabilities.md)

### Communication

All mission-related communication flows through ACF. DGP receives proposals. OSYS receives strategy. LMS receives lifecycle queries. Academy receives learning evidence. (Law 3 â€” Communication)

## Design DNA

| Rule | Compliance |
|------|-----------|
| R1 â€” Modulsingularity | Missions component focuses solely on mission lifecycle oversight |
| R2 â€” Dependency Order | Missions depends on Reasoning, Planner, DGP; no upward dependencies |
| R3 â€” DRY | Mission patterns are captured in Knowledge, not hardcoded |
| R4 â€” Builder Pattern | Mission proposals are built through the proposeMission pipeline |
| R5 â€” Liskov Substitution | Mission operations implement the MissionOversight interface |
| R6 â€” DI over Singletons | DGP and LMS clients are injected dependencies |
| R9 â€” Deterministic | Same mission evidence produces the same outcome evaluation |
| R10 â€” Simpler Over Complex | Mission oversight uses the simplest valid supervision strategy |
| R13 â€” Design for Failure | Sou monitors missions but does not block on failure â€” alternative proposals |
| R14 â€” Paved Path | All missions flow through propose â†’ monitor â†’ evaluate â†’ learn |
| R15 â€” Open/Closed | New supervision strategies added by extending MissionOversight |
