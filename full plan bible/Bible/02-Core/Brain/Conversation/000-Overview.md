## Purpose

Conversation OS manages Sou's dialogue with users. It handles multi-turn conversation context, turn management, user intent routing, modality adaptation, and response delivery. While the Context System manages the global context window (everything Sou is aware of), Conversation OS manages the interactive flow â€” the back-and-forth between Sou and the user.

Conversation OS is the interface between Sou and the user. It packages Sou's internal reasoning into user-facing messages and delivers user input to Sou.

Conversation OS is the entry point for user interactions into the Brain. All user input (regardless of modality) enters through Conversation OS, which prepares it for Sou's consumption. All user-facing responses exit through Conversation OS, which adapts them to the appropriate modality.

## Core Concepts

### Conversation Model

```
ConversationSession {
  session_id: string
  user_id: string
  modality: "text" | "voice" | "api" | "multimodal"
  status: "active" | "idle" | "paused" | "ended"
  started_at: timestamp
  last_activity: timestamp
  turn_count: number
  metadata: {
    user_preferences: UserPreferences
    active_channels: string[]
    context_tags: string[]
  }
}

ConversationTurn {
  turn_id: string
  session_id: string
  turn_number: number
  role: "user" | "sou" | "system"
  content: TurnContent
  modality: string
  timestamp: timestamp
  response_to?: string         // turn_id this is responding to
  metadata: {
    processing_time_ms: number
    intent?: string
    sentiment?: number         // -1.0 (negative) â€“ 1.0 (positive)
    confidence?: number        // 0.0â€“1.0
  }
}

TurnContent {
  text: string
  attachments?: Attachment[]
  structured_data?: Record<string, unknown>
}

UserPreferences {
  formality: number            // 0.0â€“1.0
  verbosity: number            // 0.0â€“1.0
  preferred_modality: string
  timezone: string
  language: string
  accessibility: string[]      // e.g., "screen_reader", "high_contrast"
}
```

### 1. Session Manager

Manages the lifecycle of conversation sessions:

| Session State | Description | Enter | Exit |
|---------------|-------------|-------|------|
| active | Ready for interaction | User initiates | Session ends |
| idle | No activity, waiting timeout | No input for N seconds | Input arrives or timeout |
| paused | Suspended by user or system | User/system pauses | User/system resumes |
| ended | Session terminated | User ends or timeout | Session archived |

Session timeout:
- Idle timeout: 5 minutes of inactivity â†’ auto-pause
- Absolute timeout: 24 hours â†’ force-end
- Max idle sessions: 10 per user â†’ oldest auto-ended

Session state is persisted in Memory OS. Active sessions are cached in Conversation OS.

### 2. Turn Manager

Manages the turn-by-turn flow of conversation:

| Turn Phase | Responsibility | Duration |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Receive | Accept user input via modality adapter | < 100ms |
| Parse | Extract intent, entities, sentiment | < 500ms |
| Route | Forward to Sou via ACF | < 100ms |
| Process | Sou processes and produces response | Variable |
| Build | Package response for modality | < 200ms |
| Deliver | Send response to user | < 100ms |

Turn management includes:
- Turn ordering: Ensures turns are processed in sequence
- Turn deduplication: Prevents duplicate processing of the same input
- Turn timeout: If Sou doesn't respond within 30 seconds, timeout and notify user
- Turn history: Maintains a sliding window of recent turns for context

### 3. Modality Adapter

Adapts input and output for different communication modalities:

| Modality | Input Adaptation | Output Adaptation |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Text | Direct passthrough | Format with markdown, code blocks |
| Voice | Speech-to-text via Voice System | Text-to-speech via Voice System |
| API | Parse structured request | Return structured response |
| Multimodal | Combine text + image/audio | Deliver text + optional media |

The Modality Adapter allows Sou to be modality-agnostic. Sou always processes text internally; the adapter handles translation to/from the user's modality.

### 4. Intent Router

Routes user input based on detected intent before it reaches Sou:

| Intent | Example | Route | Sou Receives |
|--------|---------|-------|--------------|
| question | "What is X?" | Direct to Sou | Full query |
| command | "Do X" | Direct to Sou | Full command |
| chit-chat | "How are you?" | Direct to Sou (with personality context) | Greeting + personality |
| meta | "What can you do?" | Direct to Sou (capability context) | Capability inquiry |
| feedback | "That was wrong" | Direct to Sou (with reflection context) | Feedback + reflection trigger |
| system | "Change settings" | Route to Personality/Settings | Setting change request |
| emergency | "Stop everything" | Interrupt via Attention System | Immediate interrupt |

The Intent Router is lightweight â€” it classifies intent using a simple rule-based matcher before passing to Sou. Complex intent resolution is handled by Sou via Cognitive OS.

### 5. Response Builder

After Sou produces a response, the Response Builder packages it for delivery:

| Component | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Style application | Apply personality style profile |
| Formatting | Add markdown, code blocks, lists |
| Attachment handling | Process file references, images |
| Modality conversion | Text â†’ speech if voice modality |
| Length adjustment | Truncate or summarize if exceeds limits |
| Continuation | Split long responses into chunks |
| Confidence annotation | Add confidence indicators for uncertain answers |

## Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Enforcement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| CONV-001 | Every user message has exactly one response | Algorithmic â€” turn pairing enforced |
| CONV-002 | Turn ordering is strictly sequential | Architectural â€” Turn Manager sequences turns |
| CONV-003 | Sou processes text internally regardless of modality | Architectural â€” Modality Adapter normalizes input |
| CONV-004 | Conversation OS is stateless â€” sessions live in Memory OS | Architectural â€” no internal persistence |
| CONV-005 | User preferences are persistent across sessions | API-level â€” preferences stored in Memory OS |
| CONV-006 | Sessions auto-end after 24 hours | Algorithmic â€” Session Manager enforces timeout |

| BRAIN-001 | Every cognitive service is inside the Brain. | Architectural - documented in Bible directory structure. |
| BRAIN-007 | Cognitive services are stateless. All state lives in Memory OS. Services are reusable pipelines. | Architectural - service restarts lose no state. Memory OS is the single state authority. |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

Conversation OS operates under Law 8 (Verification-First) and Law 7 (Capability Bounds): every operation is authorized by the Security Kernel before execution, and the component never exceeds its declared capabilities. (Physics/008-Security.md)

### Evidence

Per Law 4 (Evidence), Conversation OS emits an evidence record for each significant state change - what changed, by whom, on what basis, with what outcome - delivered through ACF and persisted by EVS. (Physics/005-Events.md)

### Lifecycle

Per Law 6 (Lifecycle Compliance), Conversation OS instances follow the canonical LMS lifecycle (Draft -> Active -> Suspended -> Archived) and are terminated deterministically; orphan states are prevented. (Physics/006-Lifecycles.md)

### Capability Bounds

Per Law 7 (Capability Bounds), Conversation OS declares its capabilities at creation and operates only within them; capability expansion requires reauthorization through the Security Kernel. (Physics/007-Capabilities.md)

## Design DNA

| Rule | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| R1 â€” Modulsingularity | Conversation OS does one thing: manage dialogue flow |
| R2 â€” Dependency Order | Depends on Memory OS, Attention System; no upward deps |
| R3 â€” DRY | Session model defined once in Conversation Model |
| R4 â€” Builder Pattern | Response built by Intent Router â†’ Sou â†’ Response Builder |
| R5 â€” Liskov Substitution | Any ModalityCodec implements the interface |
| R6 â€” DI over Singletons | Modality codecs and intent classifiers injected |
| R9 â€” Deterministic | Same input produces same response (Sou may vary) |
| R10 â€” Simpler Over Complex | Turn management uses sequential ordering |
| R13 â€” Design for Failure | Turn timeouts always produce user notification |
| R14 â€” Paved Path | All user input flows through `receiveMessage` |
| R15 â€” Open/Closed | New modalities added via ModalityCodec, not by modifying core |
