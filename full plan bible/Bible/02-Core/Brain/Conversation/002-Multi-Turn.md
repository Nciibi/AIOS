## Purpose

Multi-Turn management handles the sequential flow of conversation turns â€” ensuring turns are processed in order, managing turn pairing (user message -> Sou response), enforcing turn timeouts, maintaining a sliding window of turn history, deduplicating identical inputs, and orchestrating concurrent input handling. It is the component within Conversation OS that guarantees every user message receives exactly one response (CONV-001) and that turns proceed in strict sequential order (CONV-002).

## Data Model

### TurnRecord

```typescript
TurnRecord {
  turn_id: string                     // Unique turn identifier (UUID v7)
  session_id: string                  // Owning session
  turn_number: number                 // Monotonically increasing per session
  role: "user" | "sou" | "system"
  content: string                     // Normalized text content
  modality: "text" | "voice" | "api" | "multimodal"
  timestamp: timestamp                // When the turn was received/created
  response_to?: string                // turn_id this is responding to
  status: "received" | "parsed" | "routing" | "processing" | "built" | "delivered" | "failed"
  processing_stages: {
    received_at: timestamp
    parsed_at?: timestamp
    routed_at?: timestamp
    processing_started_at?: timestamp
    processing_completed_at?: timestamp
    built_at?: timestamp
    delivered_at?: timestamp
    failed_at?: timestamp
  }
  metadata: {
    content_hash: string              // SHA-256 of normalized content
    idempotency_key?: string          // For deduplication
    intent?: string
    confidence?: number
    token_count?: number
    error?: string
    retry_count: number
    queue_wait_ms?: number
  }
}
```

### TurnPair

```typescript
TurnPair {
  pair_id: string                     // Unique pair identifier
  user_turn_id: string                // TurnRecord turn_id (role: user)
  sou_turn_id?: string                // TurnRecord turn_id (role: sou)
  started_at: timestamp               // When user turn was received
  completed_at?: timestamp            // When Sou response was delivered
  duration_ms?: number                // completed_at - started_at
  status: "pending" | "active" | "completed" | "failed"
  failure_reason?: string
}
```

### TurnHistory

```typescript
TurnHistory {
  session_id: string
  pairs: TurnPair[]
  sliding_window_size: number         // Default: 50
  current_turn_number: number
  total_pairs: number
  overflow_archived_to: string        // Episodic Memory key for overflow pairs
}
```

### TurnTimeout

```typescript
TurnTimeoutConfig {
  stage_timeouts: {
    receive: { timeout_ms: 100, action: "skip" }
    parse: { timeout_ms: 500, action: "skip" }
    route: { timeout_ms: 100, action: "skip" }
    process: { timeout_ms: 30000, action: "notify" }
    build: { timeout_ms: 5000, action: "force_deliver" }
    deliver: { timeout_ms: 10000, action: "retry" }
  }
  default_action: "notify"            // Fallback action
  notify_message: string              // "Sou is taking longer than expected..."
  max_retries: number                 // Per stage, default: 1
}

TimedOutTurn {
  turn_id: string
  session_id: string
  stage: string
  elapsed_ms: number
  action: "notify" | "retry" | "skip" | "force_deliver" | "interrupt"
  handled_at?: timestamp
}
```

## Turn Lifecycle

```
Receive â†’ Parse â†’ Route â†’ Process â†’ Build â†’ Deliver
```

Each stage has strict timing requirements and validation:

| Stage | Max Duration | Validation | Failure Behavior |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Receive | 100ms | Content non-empty, valid session, no duplicate | Reject with CONV_INVALID_INPUT |
| Parse | 500ms | Extract intent, entities, content hash | Skip parse, use raw content |
| Route | 100ms | ACF delivery acknowledgment | Retry once, then fail |
| Process | 30000ms | Sou produces valid response | Notify user, offer options |
| Build | 5000ms | Response packaged for modality | Force deliver partial response |
| Deliver | 10000ms | Delivery acknowledgment from channel | Retry once, then log failure |

### Stage Transitions

```
receive â”€â”€â–º parse â”€â”€â–º route â”€â”€â–º process â”€â”€â–º build â”€â”€â–º deliver
  â”‚            â”‚         â”‚           â”‚          â”‚           â”‚
  â””â”€â”€ fail â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€ fail â”€â”´â”€â”€ fail â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€ fail â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€ fail â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€ fail
```

Transitions only move forward. A failed turn at any stage transitions to `failed` status and cannot resume.

## Turn Sequencing

### Strict Sequential Ordering

Turn N completes (reaches `delivered` or `failed`) before turn N+1 begins processing. Sequencing is enforced by:

```typescript
// Pseudo-enforcement rule
if (session.current_pending_turn !== null) {
  queue.enqueue(newTurn, priority)
} else {
  session.current_pending_turn = newTurn
  processTurn(newTurn)
}
```

### Turn Queue

When a user sends input while Sou is processing a previous turn, the input is enqueued:

| Queue Position | Priority Level | Description |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 (Highest) | System message | Sou-injected system messages |
| 2 | User retry | Re-sent input after user timeout |
| 3 | New user input | Fresh user message |
| 4 (Lowest) | Sou inject | Sou-initiated interjections |

### Queue Depth

- Default depth: 5 queued turns
- When queue is full: oldest non-system entry is dropped with `CONV_QUEUE_FULL` warning
- System messages are never dropped from queue
- Each queued entry stores `enqueued_at` timestamp for wait-time metrics

## Turn Pairing

### Pairing Rule (CONV-001)

Every user turn must have exactly one Sou response. TurnPair enforces this:

```typescript
function pairResponse(userTurnId: string, souResponse: TurnRecord): TurnPair {
  const pair = new TurnPair({
    user_turn_id: userTurnId,
    sou_turn_id: souResponse.turn_id,
    started_at: getUserTurn(userTurnId).timestamp,
    status: "active"
  })
  return pairStore.save(pair)
}
```

### Orphan Detection

Orphan detection runs on a 5-second heartbeat:

| Condition | Duration Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| User turn received, no pair created | 500ms after receive | Log warning, create pair in pending |
| Pair active > process timeout | 30s after active | Emit CONV.TurnTimeout, notify user |
| Pair active > 2x process timeout | 60s after active | Interrupt Sou, fail pair |

### Response Deduplication

A content hash comparison prevents the same Sou response from being delivered twice:

- On Build stage, compute SHA-256 of response content
- Compare against `last_delivered_hash` on the session
- If match: emit CONV.ResponseDuplicateSuppressed, skip delivery
- Hash cleared when new user turn begins

## Turn Timeout

| Stage | Default Timeout | Action | Details |
|-------|----------------|--------|---------|
| Receive | 100ms | Skip | Drop malformed input silently |
| Parse | 500ms | Skip | Use raw content, bypass parsing |
| Route | 100ms | Retry | Retry ACF delivery once |
| Process (Sou) | 30s | Notify | Emit CONV.TurnTimeout, tell user "Sou is taking longer than expected..." |
| Build | 5s | Force deliver | Deliver what is available, mark partial |
| Deliver | 10s | Retry | Retry delivery once, then log failure |

### Timeout Protocol

1. Stage timer starts when stage enters
2. Timer fires â†’ emit `CONV.TurnTimeout` with stage, elapsed_ms, action
3. Action executed per table above
4. For Process timeout with "notify" action:
   - User notification: "Sou is taking longer than expected..."
   - Options offered: wait / retry / skip
   - If user chooses interrupt: send interrupt signal to Sou via ACF
   - Sou interrupt flow:
     ```
     CONV.TurnTimeout â†’ user notified â†’ user interrupts
       â†’ send ACF.Interrupt(turn_id)
       â†’ Sou halts processing
       â†’ Turn marked failed
       â†’ Queue advanced to next turn
     ```

## Turn History

### Sliding Window

The last N turn pairs are kept in-memory for rapid access:

| Property | Default | Configurable |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Window size | 50 pairs | Per-session via configuration |
| Retention policy | FIFO eviction | Oldest pairs moved to Episodic Memory |
| Access method | getTurnHistory(session_id, limit?) | |

### Persistence

When pairs exceed the sliding window:

1. Overflow pairs are serialized to Episodic Memory via Memory OS
2. Episodic Memory key format: `conv:history:{session_id}:{start_turn}-{end_turn}`
3. On session resume, last N pairs are reloaded from Episodic Memory
4. Total history is unbounded (limited only by Episodic Memory capacity)

### Turn Replay

Turns can be replayed to restore context:

```typescript
function replayTurns(session_id: string, from_turn: number, count: number): TurnRecord[]
```

- Fetches turns from Episodic Memory if not in sliding window
- Returns ordered array of TurnRecords for context restoration
- Used when Sou needs to reconstruct conversation state after restart
- Events emitted per replayed turn: `CONV.TurnReplayed`

## Turn Deduplication

### Content Hash

Each incoming user turn gets a SHA-256 content hash (normalized: trimmed, lowercased):

```typescript
function computeContentHash(content: string): string {
  const normalized = content.trim().toLowerCase()
  return crypto.createHash("sha256").update(normalized).digest("hex")
}
```

### Idempotency Key

- Client may provide `idempotency_key` in the message header
- If not provided, server generates one from `session_id + turn_number + content_hash`
- Key stored on the TurnRecord metadata
- TTL of idempotency key: 5 minutes after turn completion

### Duplicate Detection Flow

```
Receive stage:
  1. Compute content_hash from input
  2. Look up hash in session's recent hashes (last 10 turns)
  3. If idempotency_key provided, check that first
  4. If duplicate found:
     a. Return existing turn_id
     b. Emit CONV.DuplicateSuppressed
     c. Skip processing â€” do not re-enter lifecycle
```

### Duplicate Behavior

| Scenario | Detection Method | Action |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Same content, same session | content_hash match | Return existing turn_id, skip |
| Same idempotency_key, same session | idempotency_key match | Return existing turn_id, skip |
| Same content, different session | Not a duplicate | Process normally |
| Same content, different turn_number | turn_number mismatch | Process normally (past window) |

## Concurrent Input Handling

### User Sends While Sou is Processing

```
User sends message M1
  â†’ M1 enters Receive stage
  â†’ M1 advances to Process stage â†’ Sou starts processing
  
User sends message M2 while Sou processes M1
  â†’ M2 enters Receive stage
  â†’ Turn Manager detects current_pending_turn !== null
  â†’ M2 is enqueued with priority "new user input"
  â†’ User notified: "Message received, waiting for current response..."
  â†’ Emit CONV.TurnQueued { turn_id: M2.turn_id, position: 1 }
  
Sou finishes processing M1
  â†’ M1 advances Build â†’ Deliver
  â†’ Turn Manager dequeues M2
  â†’ M2 begins lifecycle at Receive stage
```

### Queue Management

```typescript
function processQueue(session_id: string): void {
  const queue = sessionQueues.get(session_id)
  if (!queue || queue.isEmpty()) return

  const nextTurn = queue.dequeue()  // Priority-ordered dequeue
  session.current_pending_turn = nextTurn
  processTurn(nextTurn)
}
```

### "User is Typing" Indicator

User-typing indicators (e.g., WebSocket `typing` frames) do not create turns:

1. `typing` signal received â†’ update `session.last_typing_at` timestamp
2. No turn record created
3. If typing persists > 5s without message: emit `CONV.TypingExpired` (no further action)
4. If message arrives: clear typing timer, proceed with normal receive

### Queue Flush

On session end, all queued turns are:

1. Marked as failed with reason `session_ended`
2. Emit `CONV.TurnQueueFlushed` with count of dropped turns
3. Memory is freed

## Internal Interface

```typescript
interface TurnManager {
  // Lifecycle
  startTurn(session_id: string, content: string, modality: string, options?: {
    idempotency_key?: string
    role?: "user" | "system"
  }): TurnRecord

  completeTurn(turn_id: string): void
  failTurn(turn_id: string, reason: string): void

  // Query
  getTurn(turn_id: string): TurnRecord | null
  getTurnPair(pair_id: string): TurnPair | null
  getTurnHistory(session_id: string, limit?: number): TurnPair[]

  // Pairing
  pairResponse(user_turn_id: string, sou_response: TurnRecord): TurnPair
  getOrphanedTurns(session_id: string): TurnRecord[]

  // Queue
  enqueueTurn(session_id: string, turn: TurnRecord): QueueResult
  processQueue(session_id: string): void
  flushQueue(session_id: string): void
  getQueueDepth(session_id: string): number

  // Timeouts
  checkTimeouts(session_id: string): TimedOutTurn[]
  interruptSou(session_id: string, turn_id: string): void

  // Deduplication
  computeHash(content: string): string
  isDuplicate(content_hash: string, session_id: string): boolean
  registerHash(session_id: string, turn_id: string, content_hash: string): void

  // History
  archivePairs(session_id: string, count: number): void
  replayTurns(session_id: string, from_turn: number, count: number): TurnRecord[]
}

type QueueResult = {
  position: number
  estimated_wait_ms: number
  queue_depth: number
  dropped?: {
    turn_id: string
    reason: string
  }
}
```

## Events

| Event | Fields | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| CONV.TurnStarted |      turn_id, session_id, turn_number, role, modality | A new turn enters the lifecycle |
| CONV.TurnStageChanged |      turn_id, session_id, from_stage, to_stage, elapsed_ms | Turn advanced to next stage |
| CONV.TurnCompleted |      turn_id, session_id, pair_id, duration_ms | Turn reached delivered status |
| CONV.TurnFailed |      turn_id, session_id, stage, reason | Turn failed at a stage |
| CONV.TurnQueued |      turn_id, session_id, position, queue_depth | Turn enqueued while another is active |
| CONV.TurnTimeout |      turn_id, session_id, stage, elapsed_ms, action | Stage timer expired |

| CONV.TurnOrphanDetected |      turn_id, session_id, elapsed_ms | User turn without paired response detected |

## Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Enforcement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| CONV-001 | Every user message has exactly one Sou response | Algorithmic â€” TurnPair enforces 1:1 mapping; orphan detection catches violations |
| CONV-002 | Turn ordering is strictly sequential (turn N completes before N+1 starts) | Architectural â€” current_pending_turn gate blocks concurrent lifecycle |
| CONV-007 | Turn stage transitions are monotonic (forward-only, never backwards) | Algorithmic â€” stage transition validation rejects reverse moves |
| CONV-008 | No turn is processed more than once (idempotency) | Algorithmic â€” deduplication via content_hash and idempotency_key |
| CONV-009 | The turn queue never exceeds max depth | Algorithmic â€” oldest non-system entry dropped when full |
| CONV-010 | Every TimedOutTurn has a corresponding action executed | Algorithmic â€” timeout handler executes action before returning |
| CONV-011 | Turn IDs are globally unique across all sessions | Schema â€” UUID v7 generation with collision detection |

| BRAIN-001 | Every cognitive service is inside the Brain. | Architectural - documented in Bible directory structure. |
| BRAIN-007 | Cognitive services are stateless. All state lives in Memory OS. Services are reusable pipelines. | Architectural - service restarts lose no state. Memory OS is the single state authority. |
## Error Cases

| Condition | Error Code | Behavior |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Turn started on unknown session | `CONV_SESSION_NOT_FOUND` | Return error; caller must create session first |
| Duplicate turn detected at receive | `CONV_DUPLICATE_TURN` | Return existing turn_id, emit DuplicateSuppressed, skip lifecycle |
| Turn queue at max depth | `CONV_QUEUE_FULL` | Drop oldest non-system entry, enqueue new turn, emit warning |
| Stage transition violates order | `CONV_INVALID_TRANSITION` | Return error; stage cannot move backwards |
| Pairing user turn already paired | `CONV_TURN_ALREADY_PAIRED` | Return existing pair, do not create duplicate |
| Orphan turn exceeds max timeout | `CONV_ORPHAN_TIMEOUT` | Interrupt Sou, fail pair, notify user |
| Content hash collision with different content | `CONV_HASH_COLLISION` | Log warning, append salt and rehash |
| Queue entry dropped due to session end | `CONV_QUEUE_FLUSHED` | Fail all queued turns with session_ended reason |

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Normal Turn Flow

```
User sends: "What is the weather?"
  1. startTurn(session_id, "What is the weather?", "text")
     â†’ TurnRecord created, status: received
  2. Parse stage completes â†’ status: parsed
  3. Route stage â†’ input delivered to Sou â†’ status: routing
  4. Sou responds â†’ status: processing â†’ processing_completed_at set
  5. pairResponse(user_turn_id, sou_response)
     â†’ TurnPair created, status: active
  6. Build stage â†’ response formatted â†’ status: built
  7. Deliver stage â†’ response sent to user â†’ status: delivered
  8. TurnPair completed â†’ stats recorded
```

### Pattern 2: Timeout Recovery

```
User sends: "Analyze this 100-page document"
  â†’ Turn enters Process stage
  â†’ Sou starts processing
  â†’ 30 seconds pass â†’ Timeout fires
  
  1. CONV.TurnTimeout emitted
  2. User notified: "Sou is taking longer than expected..."
  3. User offered: wait / retry / skip
  4. User chooses "skip"
  5. interruptSou(session_id, turn_id) called
     â†’ ACF.Interrupt signal sent to Sou
  6. failTurn(turn_id, "user_skipped_after_timeout")
  7. TurnPair marked failed
  8. processQueue(session_id) â†’ next turn dequeued and started
```

### Pattern 3: Concurrent Input Queuing

```
User sends message A â†’ starts processing
User sends message B while A is processing:
  1. B turn created, status: received
  2. enqueueTurn(session_id, B) â†’ QueueResult { position: 1 }
  3. CONV.TurnQueued emitted
  4. User sees: "Message received, waiting for current response..."

System message injected during A's processing:
  1. Priority calculated: system > user input
  2. enqueueTurn(session_id, systemMsg) â†’ QueueResult { position: 0 }
  3. System message jumps ahead of B in queue

A completes â†’ processQueue dequeues system message first
  â†’ system message processed and delivered
  â†’ processQueue dequeues B
  â†’ B begins lifecycle
```


## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

Conversation OS operates under Law 8 (Verification-First) and Law 7 (Capability Bounds): every operation is authorized by the Security Kernel before execution, and the component never exceeds its declared capabilities. (Physics/008-Security.md)

### Evidence

Per Law 4 (Evidence), Conversation OS emits an evidence record for each significant state change - what changed, by whom, on what basis, with what outcome - delivered through ACF and persisted by EVS. (Physics/005-Events.md)

### Lifecycle

Per Law 6 (Lifecycle Compliance), Conversation OS instances follow the canonical LMS lifecycle (Draft -> Active -> Suspended -> Archived) and are terminated deterministically; orphan states are prevented. (Physics/006-Lifecycles.md)

### Capability Bounds

Per Law 7 (Capability Bounds), Conversation OS declares its capabilities at creation and operates only within them; capability expansion requires reauthorization through the Security Kernel. (Physics/007-Capabilities.md)

## Design DNA

| Rule | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| R1 â€” Modulsingularity | Turn Manager handles only turn lifecycle, sequencing, and pairing |
| R2 â€” Dependency Order | Depends on ACF (Sou) and Memory OS; no upward deps |
| R3 â€” DRY | Turn model defined once in Data Model; shared across all stages |
| R4 â€” Builder Pattern | Turn built through sequential stage transitions, each adding fidelity |
| R5 â€” Liskov Substitution | Any TurnManager implementation satisfies the interface |
| R6 â€” DI over Singletons | Timeout configs and queue strategies injected |
| R9 â€” Deterministic | Same input with same state produces same lifecycle outcome |
| R10 â€” Simpler Over Complex | Strict sequential ordering avoids concurrent state complexity |
| R13 â€” Design for Failure | Every stage has timeout; failed turns always notify user |
| R14 â€” Paved Path | All turns flow through startTurn â†’ stages â†’ complete/fail |
| R15 â€” Open/Closed | New stage behaviors added via stage handler config, not by modifying lifecycle core |
