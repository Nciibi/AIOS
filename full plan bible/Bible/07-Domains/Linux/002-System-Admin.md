## Purpose

Enable AIOS to manage Linux system state â€” users, services, packages, and filesystems â€” across single nodes or fleets via declarative, idempotent operations.

## Architecture

System administration follows a playbook-driven model. Desired state is defined in resource manifests (UserAccount, SystemService, etc.) which are reconciled by the SysAdminWorker agent. A playbook is an ordered collection of operations that can target one or many hosts. Each operation is dry-run before apply to verify correctness. Execution reports are stored as RunbookRecord entries for audit compliance.

## Core Concepts / Operations

- **manage_user(user)** â€” creates or removes user account with groups, shell, and SSH keys
- **configure_service(service)** â€” ensures service is in desired run state and enablement
- **install_package(manifest)** â€” installs, removes, or updates a package from repository
- **mount_filesystem(config)** â€” mounts or unmounts filesystem per fstab specification
- **run_playbook(operations, targets)** â€” executes sequence of operations across hosts with dry-run
- **dry_run_playbook(operations, targets)** â€” previews changes without applying them

### Operations Table

| set_firewalld_zone | Assigns firewalld zone to interfaces | firewalld running; zone exists | Interface assigned to zone; firewall rules reloaded |

## Internal Interfaces (table)

## Events (table)

| LNX.EventType |  Produced When | Fields |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| LNX.UserCreated |  UserHandler creates a new user account | username, uid, groups, homeDirectory, createdBy |
| LNX.UserDeleted |  UserHandler removes a user account | username, uid, deletedBy, backupRef |
| LNX.UserModified |  UserHandler changes user account attributes | username, changes, modifiedBy |
| LNX.ServiceRestarted |  ServiceHandler restarts a system service | serviceName, reason, previousState, restartDuration |

## Error Cases (table with Code, Condition, Severity, Recovery)

| Code | Condition | Severity | Recovery |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| SYS-001 | Service dependency cycle detected | Error | Reject playbook, report dependency graph cycle |
| SYS-002 | Package dependency conflict | Error | Report conflicting packages, suggest resolution |
| SYS-003 | Permission denied on system operation | Warning | Log failure, verify capability grants and sudoers |
| SYS-004 | Mount point already in use | Error | Unmount active mount or choose different path |
| SYS-005 | User already exists with conflicting UID | Warning | Skip user creation, log conflict for review |
| SYS-006 | Playbook operation timeout | Error | Halt playbook, roll back completed ops if configured |
| SYS-007 | Package repository unreachable | Warning | Log, attempt to use local cache or mirror fallback |

## Invariants (table with ID, Rule, Enforcement)

| ID | Rule | Enforcement |
|----|------|-------------|
| SYS-INV-01 | Every system mutation is preceded by a dry-run | Playbook engine rejects apply without prior dry-run |
| SYS-INV-02 | All system operations are idempotent | Handlers compare current vs desired state before acting |
| SYS-INV-03 | Service enablement state is persisted across reboots | ServiceHandler manages enable symlinks or preset |
| SYS-INV-04 | Package holds are preserved across operations | PackageHandler checks hold flag before upgrade/remove |
| SYS-INV-05 | Filesystem state is reconciled against fstab | FsHandler ensures fstab is updated before mount |
| SYS-INV-06 | Playbook execution produces an auditable RunbookRecord | Engine records every operation outcome with timestamp |

## Design DNA

| Rule | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| R1 - Modulsingularity | Playbooks compose individual operations; handlers delegate to platform-specific implementations |
| R2 - Dependency Order | All desired state is declared in resource manifests; no magic defaults |
| R3 - DRY | Package versions pinned by hash or explicit version; playbooks immutable after execution |
| R4 - Builder Pattern | SysAdminWorker is stateless; state lives in resource manifests |
| R5 - Liskov Substitution | Every operation checks current state before applying change |
| R6 - DI over Singletons | Every mutation emits a typed event; dry-run provides full diff |
| R9 - Deterministic | Playbook halts on first error; partial apply requires explicit rollback config |
| R10 - Simpler Over Complex | Each operation runs with minimum required privileges; escalation explicit |
| R13 - Design for Failure | If package repo is down, system still serves already-deployed configs |
| R14 - Paved Path | RunbookRecords are append-only; past operations never mutated |
| R15 - Open/Closed | Every failure returns structured error code and recovery hint |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

Linux operates under Law 8 (Verification-First) and Law 7 (Capability Bounds): every operation is authorized by the Security Kernel before execution, and the component never exceeds its declared capabilities. (Physics/008-Security.md)

### Evidence

Per Law 4 (Evidence), Linux emits an evidence record for each significant state change - what changed, by whom, on what basis, with what outcome - delivered through ACF and persisted by EVS. (Physics/005-Events.md)

### Lifecycle

Per Law 6 (Lifecycle Compliance), Linux instances follow the canonical LMS lifecycle (Draft -> Active -> Suspended -> Archived) and are terminated deterministically; orphan states are prevented. (Physics/006-Lifecycles.md)

### Capability Bounds

Per Law 7 (Capability Bounds), Linux declares its capabilities at creation and operates only within them; capability expansion requires reauthorization through the Security Kernel. (Physics/007-Capabilities.md)
