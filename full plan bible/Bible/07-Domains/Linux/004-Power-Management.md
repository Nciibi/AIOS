## Purpose

Enable AIOS to manage Linux power states â€” suspend/resume, CPU frequency scaling, ACPI configuration, and thermal monitoring â€” to optimize energy consumption while preserving system stability.

## Architecture

Power management is modeled as a state machine with transitions between S0 (working), S1-S3 (sleep), S4 (hibernate), and S5 (power off). PowerProfiles bundle governor settings, wakeup sources, and timeout policies. The PowerManager agent reconciles desired profile against hardware capabilities. Thermal zones are monitored continuously; critical thresholds trigger alerts or automatic profile demotion. Suspend operations save running state, verify wakeup readiness, and emit events on completion.

## Error Cases (table with Code, Condition, Severity, Recovery)

| Code | Condition | Severity | Recovery |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| PWR-001 | Power state S3/S4 not supported by hardware | Error | Fall back to supported state, log capabilities |
| PWR-002 | CPU governor not available on this hardware | Warning | Fall back to nearest available governor |
| PWR-003 | Resume from suspend failed (driver timeout) | Critical | Force reboot, collect crash dump |
| PWR-004 | Thermal zone at critical temperature | Critical | Trigger emergency shutdown or profile demotion |
| PWR-005 | Wakeup device not found or not supported | Warning | Log, skip unsupported wakeup configuration |
| PWR-006 | Suspend blocked by active process | Error | Log blocking process list, abort suspend |
| PWR-007 | Frequency scaling driver not loaded | Warning | Load driver module or fall back to acpi-cpufreq |

## Invariants (table with ID, Rule, Enforcement)

| ID | Rule | Enforcement |
|----|------|-------------|
| PWR-INV-01 | Suspend saves running state before powering down | SuspendHandler verifies state serialization before S3/S4 |
| PWR-INV-02 | Wakeup readiness is verified after suspend config | SuspendHandler tests wakeup device before confirming config |
| PWR-INV-03 | CPU frequency never exceeds hardware max | GovernorHandler clamps scaling to hardware capabilities |
| PWR-INV-04 | Thermal trip points are monotonically increasing | ThermalHandler validates trip point ordering on config |
| PWR-INV-05 | Power profile changes are reverted on failure | ProfileHandler rolls back to previous profile if apply fails |
| PWR-INV-06 | Suspend is not initiated while critical thermal event active | PowerManager blocks suspend when thermal state is critical |

## Design DNA (table with Rule, Assessment â€” include R1,R2,R3,R4,R5,R6,R9,R10,R13,R14,R15)

| Rule | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| R1 â€” Composition over Inheritance | PowerProfile composes governor, thermal, and wakeup settings; agent composes handlers |
| R2 â€” Explicit over Implicit | All power states and governors explicitly declared; no automatic fallback without log |
| R3 â€” Immutable Artifacts | Saved suspend state is immutable snapshot; power profiles versioned |
| R4 â€” Stateless Workers | PowerManager is stateless; state held in PowerProfile resources |
| R5 â€” Idempotency | Applying same power profile twice is no-op; governor switch idempotent |
| R6 â€” Observability | Every power state transition and thermal event emits structured event |
| R9 â€” Fail Closed | On resume failure, system halts to safe recovery state; no partial boot |
| R10 â€” Least Privilege | Suspend and governor changes require elevated capability grants |
| R13 â€” Graceful Degradation | If preferred governor unsupported, fall back to nearest alternative |
| R14 â€” Data Immutability | Power profile history preserved; previous profile snapshots retained |
| R15 â€” Explicit Errors | Every failure returns typed code with recovery action |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security

Linux operates under Law 8 (Verification-First) and Law 7 (Capability Bounds): every operation is authorized by the Security Kernel before execution, and the component never exceeds its declared capabilities. (Physics/008-Security.md)

### Evidence

Per Law 4 (Evidence), Linux emits an evidence record for each significant state change - what changed, by whom, on what basis, with what outcome - delivered through ACF and persisted by EVS. (Physics/005-Events.md)

### Lifecycle

Per Law 6 (Lifecycle Compliance), Linux instances follow the canonical LMS lifecycle (Draft -> Active -> Suspended -> Archived) and are terminated deterministically; orphan states are prevented. (Physics/006-Lifecycles.md)

### Capability Bounds

Per Law 7 (Capability Bounds), Linux declares its capabilities at creation and operates only within them; capability expansion requires reauthorization through the Security Kernel. (Physics/007-Capabilities.md)
